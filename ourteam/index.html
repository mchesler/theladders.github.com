    <strong>Dmitri Mikhailov</strong> is Principal Data Architect for TheLadders. Since joining the Company in 2004 he&#8217;s had to wear many hats: writing code for both the website and internal tools, designing data structures, optimizing payment systems among many other things. While moving all these disparate bits around (many!), he&#8217;s never panicked in those inevitable “the site is down!” situations. Dmitri is able to communicate in 15 different languages, including binary codes with a wide range of computers: from IBM 360 mainframes to tiny PLCs. His latest hobbies include 3D graphics, Linux kernel programming, studying the Chinese language, and trophy fishing.

    <strong>Jon Ruttenberg</strong> is a Senior Software Engineer at TheLadders. He gave up show business to write code. He believes that it is possible to admire both C++ and Functional languages. Pointers and system calls do not scare him, but assembly language does. He thinks that Erlang is way cool and that it needs to be used more on this side of the Atlantic. He does not believe that JVM-based languages will bring world peace.
